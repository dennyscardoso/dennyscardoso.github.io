	<tr><td colspan="2" ><p>The alternative that contains the most appropriate words to respectively fit the gaps in the article excerpt below are: Oscar White Muscarella, a/an  respected archeologist at New York’s Metropolitan Museum, claims that more than 1,250 forgeries are on display in the world’s leading museums and art galleries. In his latest book, Muscarella specifically names 37 forgeries in the Louvre, 16 in the British Museum and 45 in his own museum in New York. Muscarella’s earlier claims have been heavily by some museum officials who are  opposed to his arguments. But he has good scientific evidence for his claims, showing that over 40 percent of the objects examined by the Oxford thermoluminescence laboratory are fakes.</p>

			<p>The alternative that best completes the gapped excerpt below is, respectively: US Rate Rise
The Chancellor returned from this month’s meeting of the ‘Group of Six’ with news that interest rates are to be by an average of half a percentage point in the United States. While the Chancellor has been in Dallas, city markets have been feverish with rumours of even higher increases. The US dollar has been at an all-time low for several weeks and the American trade deficit has been steadily. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has gone to Tokyo to discuss the problems which have  from pressure in Congress to tackle the deficit. He will be in Japan until next Tuesday.</p>
