		The alternative that contains the most appropriate words to respectively fit the gaps in the article excerpt below are: Oscar White Muscarella, a/an respected archeologist at New York’s Metropolitan Museum, claims that more than 1,250 forgeries are on display in the world’s leading museums and art galleries. In his latest book, Muscarella specifically names 37 forgeries in the Louvre, 16 in the British Museum and 45 in his own museum in New York. Muscarella’s earlier claims have been heavily by osme museum officials who are opposed to his arguments. But he has good scientific evidence for his claims, showing that over 40 percent of the objects examined by the Oxford thermoluminescence laboratory are fakes.
